<H2 id=title>How to sign in to Co-Trip</H2>
<H3>Using Your Co-Trip account</H3>
<P>To sign in to Co-Trip, you must have an Co-Trip account. If you used 
Co-Trip after the 1th of Nov 2012, then you have such an account. If you 
do not have one, <A href="userRegistration.html">click 
this link to create one.</A></P>
<P>If you have an Co-Trip account but forgot your user name or password, <A 
href="https://www.easychair.org/account/forgot.cgi">click this link to retrieve 
them.</A></P>
<H3>Sign-in problems</H3>
<P>If clicking on Co-Trip links repeatedly brings you to the sign-in page 
please read the following.</P>
<OL>
  <LI>To use Co-Trip you must enable cookies on your browser. Please check 
  that you have cookies enabled.</LI>
  <LI>Co-Trip will automatically terminate your session after two hours of 
  inactivity, so it is normal that you are asked to sign in again if you did not 
  work with it for more than two hours. Another possible reason for this problem 
  is the use of two different browsers or two different computers to access your 
  Co-Trip account. For security reasons, Co-Trip does not allow for a 
  simultaneous access of the same account from more than one browser or 
  computer.</LI></OL>
<P>If you have any other problems which prevent you from signing in, please get 
in touch with the organizers of the relevant conference.</P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
